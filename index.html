      This is the mermaid's reef guarded by the mermaid herself. She loves all creatures in the reef and won't allow any other animals or humans to disrupt the balance of the natural ecosystem. Her favorite animals in the reef are the jellyfishes and the turtles which is why she chose them to be what represents her reef.
